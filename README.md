# Maria Feiler's Functions

This is a collection of functions that I have created or modified throughout my time using R. 

All packages, authors, or help pages who served as inspiration or provided code will be cited within the function source code files. 

Using/modifying my functions? Feel free! But please cite me if necessary and let me know of any improvements you make! I am always open for suggestions.
